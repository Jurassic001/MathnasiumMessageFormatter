## Mathnasium Message Formatter
### Script to format Mathnasium student session information into a message to the parents
Designed for Mathnasium but could be changed to work for other tutoring services.
If you plan on using this program, change the first line of `name.txt` to your name.

#### To Do:
- Make this into a website using Github pages
    - Use cookies to remember instructor name?
- Overhaul message format
    1. Greeting
    2. Session Summary (good, bad, productive, etc.)
    3. Homework/Assessment Report
    4. Pages summary (page & mastery count)
    5. Topic summary (list of topics worked on & mastered)
    6. Session comments
    7. Closing
